    <h1>How VIP Credits Count</h1>
    <p>The VIP program is multidisciplinary by nature, attracting students from 
    schools and departments across campus. VIP credits typically count as free 
    electives or technical electives, and VIP can also be used in Senior Design 
    and Junior Design in some majors, but students must take a specific number 
    of credits their junior and senior years. Departments with consistent student 
    enrollment in VIP have established policies on how these credits count in 
    their degree programs. If your program of study is not listed, check with your
    advising office to find out how the credits would count toward your degree.</p>
